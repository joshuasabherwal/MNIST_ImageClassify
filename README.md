# Fashion-MNIST

The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains greyscale 28x28 images of fashion items in 
10 classes (found here: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). 
The dataset contains 60,000 image for training and 10,000 for testing. The 
dataset is more complicated than the well-known MNIST dataset (which contains 
handwritten digits).
